Project Overview
Our project seeks to provide a reliable method for efficiently managing library resources. It has features for 
adding books, registering members, managing borrowing and returning transactions, and keeping a transaction history. 
We built a flexible and scalable system that meets the demands of both library staff and members using object-oriented 
principles and Java programming.

Throughout this presentation, we'll showcase how each component of our system works together harmoniously, 
demonstrating its usability, reliability, and extensibility.
